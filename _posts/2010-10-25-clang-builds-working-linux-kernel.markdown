[This](http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-dev/2010-October/011711.html) is huge... very huge. It has the potential to take Linux to the next level - not just by creating a faster linux. No.

I believe, like OSX, it can lead to the next generation app development infrastructure - by leveraging the VM,  true platform independence and freedom from glibc hell.
